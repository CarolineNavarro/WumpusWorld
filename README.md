# WumpusWorld
The system aims to enable a connection between Unity and Arduino, in which the user is able to control a physical cart (programmed in the Arduino) using a bluetooth connection, in order to play a game called “The world of Wumpus” (programmed in Unity).

What is the Wumpus World?

The Wumpus World is a two-dimensional grid, where the player starts at a certain location and has to navigate the world to reach a goal. The world is populated with various elements, including pits, gold, wumpus, and walls, each with its own characteristics and behaviors. The goal of the game is to find the gold while avoiding the wumpus and pits, both which kill the agent. The player has limited actions available to it, such as moving forward, turning left, turning right, and shooting an arrow.
